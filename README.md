# 👋 Hi, I’m Adhitya Vootukuru!

I’m a Data Science major passionate about building AI-driven tools, experimenting with new technologies, and creating products that make real-world impact.

🌱 I’m constantly learning and expanding my skill set — from machine learning and data engineering to full-stack development and cloud technologies. I love working across the entire stack and bringing ideas to life, whether through predictive models, dashboards, or creative tech projects.

🎯 I’m currently:
- 🎓 Diving deep into Applied Linear Models, Machine Learning, and Database Systems  
- 💻 Working on multiple projects involving Streamlit dashboards, Databricks pipelines, ML modeling, and real-time analytics  
- 🤖 Exploring AI/ML techniques like LSTMs, XGBoost, and computer vision  
- ⚙️ Strengthening my foundations in DSA (Python, Java, C++)

- Current Postion: Data Analyst & Buisness Development Intern @ Kaye/Bassman. Incoming Analyst Intern @ Wells Fargo

✨ Fun Fact: I am big into tennis, football, and cricket! And I love attending hackatons and building random ideas into actual products.
